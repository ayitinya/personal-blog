## What is a API?

An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to communicate with each other. APIs are used to send and receive data. APIs are used by many different types of programs, including websites, mobile apps, and bots.

Many APIs are free to use, and some are paid. The APIs on this list are all free to use, but some have a hard limit on the number of request you can make per day/month. If
you need to make more requests, you can upgrade to a paid plan.

## 1. Quotes API

Quotes can be inspirational, thought-provoking, wise, or just beautifully expressed. Everyone probably has at least a few lines that they especially love and find meaningful, whether those be statements made by famous people, lines of poetry, or song lyrics. Wouldn’t it be great to have all of these things right at hand?

The Quotes API is a free API that provides a collection of quotes from famous people, movies, and more. You can use this API to create a **website** or **app** that displays quotes, or you can use it to create a **bot** that posts quotes to social media. If you chose to create a website or app, you could add a search feature so that users can search for quotes by keyword or author. You could also add a feature that allows users to save their favorite quotes and share them with others.

Visit the [Quotes API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes) website to learn more about the API and to get started.

## 2. Spotify API

Spotify is a popular music streaming service that allows users to listen to millions of songs. The Spotify API allows you to access information about the songs and artists that are available on Spotify. You can use this API to create a **website** or **app** that displays information about songs and artists, or you can use it to create a **bot** that posts information about songs and artists to social media. You can also get data about the user’s listening habits, such as their favorite artists and songs and use this data to create beautiful visualizations (for you data nerds out there).

Visit the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) website to learn more about the API and to get started.

## 3. Open Weather Map API

There is no shortage of weather apps out there, but if you want to create your own, for your portfolio, the Open Weather Map API is a great place to start. This API provides access to weather data for over 200,000 cities around the world. You can use this API to create a **website** or **app** that displays the weather for a specific location, or you can use it to create a **bot** that posts the weather for a specific location to social media. The possibilities are endless!

Visit the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) website to learn more about the API and to get started.

## 4. Facts API

This API lends itself well to creating bots that post facts to social media. You can also create an app that shows the user a new fact every day.

Visit the [Facts API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/facts) website to learn more about the API and to get started.

## 5. Movie Database API

Want to create your own IMDB? Then use TMDB. Litterally,yes. TMDB is a database of movies, TV shows, and actors. You can use this API to create a **website** or **app** that displays information about movies, TV shows, and actors. You can create your own version of Netflix, but without the streaming part. Users can search for movies and TV shows and add them to their watchlist.

Visit [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) website to learn more about the API and to get started.

## 6. Currency Exchange API

This API allows you to get the latest exchange rates for over 160 currencies. You can use this API to create a **website** or **app** that displays the exchange rate for a specific currency, or you can use it to create a **bot** that posts the exchange rate for a specific currency to telegram.

Visit the [Currency Exchange API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/convertcurrency) website to learn more about the API and to get started.

Ever wondered why a quick search on YouTube for the keywords 'React tutorials' brings up a slew of results, where the teachers often demonstrate how to build a todo app? At first glance, it might seem like a cliché or an oversimplified exercise. But today, we're here to reveal the hidden treasure within these ubiquitous tutorials.

Every software structure has core functionalities that it needs to perform. Just like a house must accommodate occupants to fulfill its purpose as a residence and a phone should be able to make calls to be functional, software, too, requires fundamental capabilities. It's hard to imagine a software that lacks the ability to read information, as nearly all applications need to perform basic operations on data.

Enter CRUD operations – the lifeblood of software development. CRUD, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, are the essential techniques that Todo App tutorials aim to teach. These seemingly basic operations may appear limited in scope, yet they form the backbone of software's data interaction and management.

Imagine a todo app as the training ground for budding developers. As you master CRUD operations, you gain an invaluable skillset that unlocks the potential to create virtually any type of application. From personal productivity tools to complex enterprise solutions, the principles you learn while building a todo app lay the foundation for limitless possibilities in the world of software development.

Mastering CRUD operations is crucial, whether you're building a todo app, a notes app, or a contact app. These operations empower software to interact with data effectively and efficiently, making them the fundamental building blocks for creating any type of application.

So, the next time you come across a tutorial focusing on building a todo app, remember that you are not just learning how to manage tasks, but you are acquiring powerful skills that can be applied to a wide range of software development projects. Embrace the knowledge of CRUD operations, and you'll be well-equipped to bring your creative app ideas to life
